<h3 align="center">A powerful, easy-to-use, and flexible framework for making Minecraft Plugins.</h3>

---

> [!CAUTION]
> Kapi is still in early development, **expect to encounter bugs and breaking changes!**

<h3>Demos and Examples can be seen <a href="http://kapimc.github.io/docs/category/demos">Here</a></h3>

# 💡 Why Kapi?

As a longtime user of the Spigot API, I became frustrated with how minimal it is. Even basic tasks required too much
boilerplate, and every time I started a new project, I found myself copy pasting the same utility functions over and
over again.

I built Kapi to solve this problem by offering a "batteries included" framework that simplifies plugin development,
allowing you to build both simple and complex plugins with ease.

# ✨ Features

- 🤖 **Commands**: Use method parameters as command arguments, with automatic parsing and method selection based on input
- 📚 **Templating System**: Easily create and manage impressive visual effects
- 📦 **ECS**: Add dynamic behaviour to your visual effects, enhancing interactivity with the world and players
- 🎨 **Particles & Block Displays Helpers**: Reduce boilerplate and improve productivity
- 📐 **Math Library**: A powerful math library built for game-specific calculations
- 💾 **Config Management**: Simplified handling of YAML configs and SQLite databases
- 🛠️ **Utility Collection**: Essential tools and helpers to streamline your plugin development
